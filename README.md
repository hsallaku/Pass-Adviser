This is my CS50x Final Project.
github username: hsallaku
email: hsallaku01@gmail.com

The name of my project is PassAdviser. The purpose was to make a password managing website
with two main features: a password generator and a password digital keychain.

Within the project directory there is a folder called PassAdviser, containing the source code.

The application.py file is the main code of the project. It is where the http server is called,
giving us a connection. Here, I also appointed certain operations for each route.

"helpers.py" is a python file containing custom functions to assist us in application.py.

"passadviser.db" is the database for this project, where all the user data are stored

The "templates" folder contains all of the html templates for each page displayed.

The "static" folder contains the css file linked to all the templates as well as image files used in the project.
