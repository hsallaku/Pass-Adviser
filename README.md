Within the project directory there is a folder called PassAdviser, containing the source code.

"application.py" is the main file. It is where the http server is called,
giving us a connection. Here, I also appointed different operations for each of the web routes specified.

"helpers.py" works like a supplementary file which holds custom functions that are called in "application.py".

"passadviser.db" is the database file and holds all the user records

The "templates" folder contains all of the html templates for each page displayed.

The "static" folder contains the css file linked to all the templates as well as image files used in the project.
